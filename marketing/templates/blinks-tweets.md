# 🦞 Blinks Tweet Templates

6 tweet templates designed to be shared with Solana Blink URLs. Each includes the `dial.to` interstitial URL for Blink rendering.

**Blink URL format:**
- Game status: `https://dial.to/?action=solana-action:{base_url}/api/actions/game-status`
- Buy claws: `https://dial.to/?action=solana-action:{base_url}/api/actions/buy-keys`

**Note:** Blinks render as interactive cards for desktop Chrome users with Phantom/Dialect wallet extensions. Mobile and non-extension users see a regular link — ensure tweet text makes sense without the Blink card.
